# Javascript Snippets for Applications

A collection of snippets, static classes and modules that I use frequently in javascript apps.

They are supposed to aid in debugging aswell as development by providing means to help understanding the application state, giving it a better idea of what's happening and why in an application.

Since I don't expect to change these files anytime soon, they are held in this repository, separated from projects that use them.

# Snippet List
